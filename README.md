ui - GMS.R and server - GMS.R:  This Shiny application connects to a SQL Server database using credentials from a YAML configuration file, retrieves cattle pedigree and reproduction data based on a user-provided GENEadvance number, and processes it to generate a detailed dataset of animals. It fetches multiple tables (cows, maternal grandsires, great-grand sires, calf forecasts, and reproduction records), merges them, calculates derived fields like age in months and days carrying calf, and assigns reproductive status based on rules. Users can toggle between viewing the full dataset or a simplified GMS lineage view in a dynamic DataTable, and they can also download the resulting dataset as a CSV.
