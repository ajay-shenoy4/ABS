ui - GMS.R and server - GMS.R: This Shiny application connects to a SQL Server database using credentials from a YAML configuration file, retrieves cattle pedigree and reproduction data based on a user-provided GENEadvance number, and processes it to generate a detailed dataset of animals. It fetches multiple tables (cows, maternal grandsires, great-grand sires, calf forecasts, and reproduction records), merges them, calculates derived fields like age in months and days carrying calf, and assigns reproductive status based on rules. Users can toggle between viewing the full dataset or a simplified GMS lineage view in a dynamic DataTable, and they can also download the resulting dataset as a CSV.

GeneAdvance Buckets: This R code is a highly technical, end-to-end pipeline for dairy herd data management, scoring, and visualization. It demonstrates advanced skills in database integration (connecting to multiple SQL and Starburst databases via `odbc` and `RJDBC`), data wrangling with `dplyr` and `purrr`, and dynamic data cleaning and alignment of multiple CSV datasets. Herds are scored across production, fitness, and conformation traits, assigned to custom buckets using rule-based and distance-to-bounding-box logic, and anomalies are identified. The code also showcases advanced visualization techniques with `ggplot2`, including faceted temporal trend plots, stacked bar charts, and trait range visualizations, providing clear, publication-quality insights into herd performance across countries and over time. It emphasizes automation, reproducibility, and scalable data processing for complex multi-source datasets.

CDCB, CI, AHDB Audits: This R code defines a comprehensive pipeline for conducting genomic and phenotypic audits of dairy herds for a given customer. It connects to multiple databases to retrieve herd, parent, and sire data, cleans and aligns it, calculates genomic indicators, and merges relevant trait information. The pipeline then generates a wide range of visualizations and summary tables—including production, fertility, longevity, body composition, and udder health metrics—tailored to breed and customer specifications. Finally, it outputs the processed data, plots, and zipped audit folders, providing a fully automated, reproducible, and technically robust reporting framework for herd performance analysis.
